# Sorting Algorithms Project README

This repository contains the implementation of sorting algorithms as part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. The project focuses on sorting arrays and doubly linked lists using various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort.

## Project Details

### Project Information

- **Project Name:** 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
- **Team:** Janice Gathoga


### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, participants are expected to:

1. Understand at least four different sorting algorithms.
2. Grasp the concept of Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
3. Learn how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
4. Understand what constitutes a stable sorting algorithm.


### Files and Structure

- **Header File:** All function prototypes should be included in a header file named `sort.h`.
- **Readme File:** A mandatory `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- **Test Files:** Provided `print_array.c` and `print_list.c` for testing.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort (Task 0)**
   - File: `0-bubble_sort.c`
   - Big O Notations:
     - Best Case: O(n)
     - Average Case: O(n^2)
     - Worst Case: O(n^2)

2. **Insertion Sort (Task 1)**
   - File: `1-insertion_sort_list.c`
   - Big O Notations:
     - Best Case: O(n)
     - Average Case: O(n^2)
     - Worst Case: O(n^2)

3. **Selection Sort (Task 2)**
   - File: `2-selection_sort.c`
   - Big O Notations:
     - Best Case: O(n^2)
     - Average Case: O(n^2)
     - Worst Case: O(n^2)

4. **Quick Sort (Task 3)**
   - File: `3-quick_sort.c`
   - Big O Notations:
     - Best Case: O(n log n)
     - Average Case: O(n log n)
     - Worst Case: O(n^2)
